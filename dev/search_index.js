There are four types of constraint matrices supported:  \nSparseMatrixCSC for sparse constraints with nnz Theta (n).\nSparseMatrixCOO for super sparse constraints with nnz o(n).\nSymLowRankMatrix for low-rank constraints with form BDB^T. \nDiagonal for diagonal constraints. Consider using SparseMatrixCOO instead if the diagonal matrix is super sparse.\nC is the cost matrix C of size n times n. Currently we support four types mentioned above.\nb is a vector of m right-hand side values b_i.\nr is the initial rank of the solution matrix Y.\n\nOptional arguments\n\nptol: Tolerance for relative primal infeasibility, i.e.\n\nmathcalA(YY^T) - b  (1 + b_2)\n\nThe default value is 10^-2. \n\nobjtol: Tolerance for relative suboptimality, i.e. \n\nlangle C YY^T rangle - langle C X^* rangle  (1 + langle C YY^T rangle)\n\nThe default value is 10^-2. \n\nnumberlbfgsvecs: Number of L-BFGS vectors. The default value is 4.\nfprec: Break one major iteration if the relative change of the    Lagrangian value is smaller than fprec * eps(). The default value    is 10^8, which is for moderate-accuracy solutions (ptol = objtol = 10^-2). \nprior_trace_bound: A trace bound priorly known or estimated.    For example, it is n for max cut. The default value is 10^18.\nσfac: Factor for increasing the smoothing factor sigma   in the augmented Lagrangian. The default value is 20.\nrankupd_tol: Rank update tolerance. After primal infeasibility    reaches ptol and objtol is not reached for rankupd_tol    major iterations, the rank of the solution matrix Y is doubled.   The default value is 4.\nmaxtime: Maximum time in seconds for the optimization. The default    value is 36000. There may be some postprocessing overhead so    the program will not stop exactly at maxtime. If you want to    achieve a hard time limit, use terminal tools.\nprintlevel: Print level. The default value is 1.\nprintfreq: How often to print in seconds. The default value is 600.\nmaxmajoriter: Maximum number of major iterations. The default value    is 10^5.\nmaxiter: Maximum number of total iterations. The default value is 10^7.\ndataset: Dataset name for better tracking progress,    especially when executed parallely. The default value is \"\".\neval_DIMACS_errs: Whether to evaluate DIMACS errors. The default value    is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Supported-constraint-types","page":"Documentation","title":"Supported constraint types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"As mentioned, SDPLRPlus supports semidefinite programs with constraints of type","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"Diagonal, \nSparseMatrixCSC, \nSparseMatrixCOO and \nSymLowRankMatrix.
