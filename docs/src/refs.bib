  abstract = {We discuss computational enhancements for the low-rank semidefinite programming algorithm, including the extension to block semidefinite programs (SDPs), an exact linesearch procedure, and a dynamic rank reduction scheme. A truncated-Newton method is also introduced, and several preconditioning strategies are proposed. Numerical experiments illustrating these enhancements are provided on a wide class of test problems. In particular, the truncated-Newton variant is able to achieve high accuracy in modest amounts of time on maximum-cut-type SDPs.},

  abstract = {The low-rank semidefinite programming problem LRSDPris a restriction of the semidefinite programming problem SDP in which a bound r is imposed on the rank of X, and it is well known that LRSDPris equivalent to SDP if r is not too small. In this paper, we classify the local minima of LRSDPrand prove the optimal convergence of a slight variant of the successful, yet experimental, algorithm of Burer and Monteiro [5], which handles LRSDPrvia the nonconvex change of variables X=RRT. In addition, for particular problem classes, we describe a practical technique for obtaining lower bounds on the optimal solution value during the execution of the algorithm. Computational results are presented on a set of combinatorial optimization relaxations, including some of the largest quadratic assignment SDPs solved to date.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a nonlinear programming algorithm for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) in standard form. The algorithm's distinguishing feature is a change of variables that replaces the symmetric, positive semidefinite variable X of the SDP with a rectangular variable R according to the factorization X=RRT. The rank of the factorization, i.e., the number of columns of R, is chosen minimally so as to enhance computational speed while maintaining equivalence with the SDP. Fundamental results concerning the convergence of the algorithm are derived, and encouraging computational results on some large-scale test problems are also presented.},
